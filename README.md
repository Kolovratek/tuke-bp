# My Bc

My bachelor's thesis was centered around the exploration and transformation of raw data. The primary objective was to develop a web application capable of efficiently processing and visually representing data. To achieve this I used a combination of React and Django frameworks. The utilization of React allowed for the creation of dynamic and interactive user interfaces, while Django provided a robust backend infrastructure for handling data processing tasks.

## Setup

To identify the necessary frontend packages and libraries in React, please refer to the "package.json" file in the project.
This file contains a list of all the dependencies required for the project. To install these packages, navigate to the "frontend" folder and ensure you have Node.js installed. Then, run the command "npm install" in that folder, which will initiate the download and installation process for all the required packages. Next, start the server by running the command "npm start". This will launch the server and make your application accessible.

For identifying the required libraries for the backend, there is a "requirements.txt" file created, which lists all the necessary libraries. To install these libraries, you can use the command "pip3 install -r requirements.txt" in the terminal.

To run the backend, it is necessary to set up a virtual environment. You can install the virtual environment by using the command "pip3 install virtualenv" and then create the virtual environment with the command "python3 -m venv venv".

In the backend folder, there is a README.md file that contains all the commands needed to run the backend. The first step is to activate the virtual environment by running the command "source ./scripts/activate.sh" or "source venv/bin/activate". After activating the virtual environment, you can start the backend by running the command "source ./run.sh" or "python3 manage.py runserver".
